# emd-trucks-holo
This pack was created to fill a void in the current library of Garry's Mod trainbuild locomotive trucks. Most of these trucks are a combination of holos to replicate (with some semblance of accuracy) different trucks used by EMD and GMDD.

This pack was made for free distribution. Modifications are welcomed to the contents of this pack. When and if something in this pack becomes obsolete, this pack will remain up, however it is strongly reccomended that you (the downloader) use its replacement.

Thanks,
